# tasksneeze

A cute little Ruby script that tells you to do a random productive task. For dispelling indecision, providing a tinkering outlet, and keeping easily-forgotten tasks in mind. Also using this as a tool to teach myself to make MVPs first and iterate instead of spending a week of evenings making the most ambitious version of a thing.

## Features

- tells you to do a random productive/creative thing from a list
- coloured output!
- ...

See TODOs for ideas I've had for overcomplicating this.

## Installation

Needs `ruby` and `bundle`.
You *know* you gotta `bundle install`.

## Usage

Just run it with `ruby ts.rb`, doesn't take any arguments. (Yet.)
